> I think of you in the morning,  
Before the sun rises.  
When in the mist of darkness,  
My heart feels your presence.  

> I think of you when the rays of sunlight,  
Spill like waterfall, settling in my eyes.  
It feeds my heart and my soul,  
And I'm at peace.  

> I think of you at noon,  
When the heat warms my skin,  
Thoughts of you surround & overpower me,  
Images of you swirl around in a cloud funnel.  

> I think of you as the sun sets,  
And I hear your voice, soft & slow in my head.  
The birds sing gentle, sweet songs,  
Songs of everlasting love & joy.  

> I think of you in the night,  
Stillness of the moon, in its wondrous phase.  
A feeling, impossible to express,  
The anticipation of you is my greatest gift.  

> I think of you, all the time,  
And I'll wait for you till our hearts collide :maple_leaf:
