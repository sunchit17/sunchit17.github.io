### ABOUT

In this post, I'll be sharing my experience about GOCC18: Google Online Challenge Coding-New Grad(India) for university graduates 2021.  
The challenge was live on 26th September,2020 15:00 IST and ran till 26th September,2020 20:00 IST. 
The test was conducted on HackerEarth and consisted of two coding questions to be completed within a 60 minute window.  

Prior to this round, the candidates were shortlisted on the basis of their resume/cv and those shortlisted were sent the invite for the 
challenge. I was fortunate enough to receive the invite which surely serves as a great psychological boost given the current campus placement scenario.

### THE CHALLENGE

My set of questions are mentioned below :

- **FIRST QUESTION**  
Given an array A of N integers, we have to perform Q queries of type:

L R  
determine the count of distinct prime numbers that divide all array values from index L to R.

Note: Have to store each query output in an array.

Example:  
A = {4,6,3,18,36,54}  
Q = 3  
query = {{0,1},{2,5},{3,5}}

Output:  
1  
1  
2  

Explanation:  
1 - only 2 divides 4 & 6  
1 - only 3 divides 3,18,36 & 54  
2 - 2 and 3 both divide 18,36 & 54  

#### I was able to solve this question :D but failed one of the hidden test cases :(

- **SECOND QUESTION**    
Given an array A of cost of alphabets (lower case only) (size - 26), where A[i] represents the cost of the i<sup>th</sup> alphabet,
construct the lexicographically largest string 'S' such that the cost is exactly 'W' (repetition is allowed)

Example:  
A = {1,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6,7,4,3,12,4,5,6,7,8,12,45,6,21,32,9,76,1}  
W = 77

Output:  
"yz"

Explanation:  
"yz" has weight 77 and is lexicographically largest.

#### Wasn't able to solve this question :(

### EXPERIENCE

After appearing in the challenge, I believe I have to work harder on my skills so that I achieve what I've set for myself.
The level of questions was somewhere between medium and hard, in my opinion.  
Have to keep looking forward and keep working on my problem solving skills :zap:  

**_Thanks_**
