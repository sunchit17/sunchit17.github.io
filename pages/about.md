# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

A final year CSE Student at Sir M. Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology, Bangalore with a passion for mobile application development and trying out my hands at the new innovations & research in the field of Mobile Development, Deep Learning and AI. I am currently a mentor at GLUG MVIT for Flutter based development and have participated in multiple hackathons such as **NASA Space Apps**, **Flutter Hack** and **SnapChat Lensathon**. I actively contribute to open source and was a participant at **GirlScript Summer of Code 2020**. I am a firm believer of lifelong learning which is an essential aspect of thriving as a software engineer which I aspire to become :zap:

Besides all things technical, I'm a lifelong Liverpool FC fan :soccer:, love to try out my hands at different musical instruments such as Violin, Guitar and Piano :musical_keyboard:, play video games :video_game: and talk about Politics :speech_balloon:
